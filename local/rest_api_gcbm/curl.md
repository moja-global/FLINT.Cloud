<h3> GCBM API Endpoints </h3>

### Create a new GCBM simulation

The title of a new simulation can be passed or the default title `simulation` will be used. (i.e the default title of the simulation is `simulation`, here the title `run4` is used)

| **Method** | **Endpoint** | **Response code** |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| POST       | `/gcbm/new`  | 200 OK (Success)  |

Example:

```
curl -d "title=run4" -X POST http://localhost:8080/gcbm/new
```

Expected response (Success):

```json
{
  "data": "New simulation started. Please move on to the next stage for uploading files at /gcbm/upload."
}
```

### Upload configuration files
